NOTE: Only the Front-end Code is hosted on this repo

Voxelate is a modern Blog application that features top news about lifestyle, travel, technology, sports and music. Voxelate is built with a react frontend and an express backend. The state functionality of the frontend is handled with React-Redux and the application is styled with plain CSS. 

The backend is built on an express server on Node.js runtime. A MongoDb Atlas handles all the database needs for the application.
